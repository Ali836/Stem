<h1>What is coding</h1> 
<p>A code is a type of words, numbers or some other symbols used to represent a text of the purpose of classification and/or identification</p>
<ul>
  <li>Coding is a process where you assign a code to a purpose of classification or identification.</li>
  <li>Coding has many languages.Ex. (python) print:”Hello world”;</li>
  <li>A code is a way of changing information into something else.</li>
  <li>Sometimes a code is done in way of keeping a message secret.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Why try coding</h2>
<p> Why you should try coding? Many people that want to learn coding is for the pay of coding jobs that is about $34,000 and $57,000 a year and between $16-29 per hour based on location, experience and certification. Often people learn coding as a hobby coding helps with problem solving in real life. People don’t have to be a wiz at math and science to be able to code that is why a lot of people try coding. Many coding games and apps today engage the minds and curiosity of people and help teach basic coding skills, while they are helping grow creativity of  minds of those who enjoying writing, drawing, and reading</p>
<h3>where did we learn coding?</h3>
<p>We wanted to learn how to code and we found a website called <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/ ">Codecadamy</a> where it goes by lesson and those lessons are divided in units. It is divided (the page) into 3 parts. To the right it has the example of the website (what your coding). In the center you have the codes it usually tells you what you'll be doing in the rest of the lesson, and to the left it gives you the actual lesson it explains what is the attribute, etc. and how you add it to a file and why add it. Then it give you the instructions of where you should place the attribute.</p>

<h4><b>How much do we know?</b></h4> 
<p>  I did a series of test (10 tests) with 20 questions each test in website called <a href="http://www.pskills.org/ ">Programming Skills </a> and the result are in the table below, the average of our knowledge is 59% correct. Even if we know the basics of coding we have a lot to learn, we are barely at 42% in our complete lesson in html.<b>What does html mean?</b> Html means Hypertext Markup Language.

<h5><b>Why did we pick this project?</b></h5>
<ol>
   <li>We thought it was a challenge to try something knew and more advanced.</li>
   <li>We can actually study this and get a master's degree, etc.</li>
   <li>It is fun and it has kept us busy.</li>
   <li>We had learned not only coding but lots of other stuff that might help us in the future.</li>
   <li>We have never tried nothing like coding and we wanted to learn the basics, etc.</li> 
   <li>It is fun to learn what we use on a day to day bases</li> 
   <p><b> Why was this a challenge?</b> I guess that the challenge of this project is the speed of the rate that we are learning from  
   and how can we use a simple language to create great amazing things.</p>
   <h6><b>Hypothesis</b></h6>
   <p> If we study and complete more lessons in <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/ ">Codecadamy</a> ,then our test scores will go up, because we will n=know and understand more of the basics.</p>
 <h7><b>Variables</b></h7>  
 <p>Our variables are very different from the rest, because we didn't really have material and things that we change. So we switched it up a little</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Independent Variable:</b>How many lessons we complete.</li>
<li><b>Dependent Variable:</b>The amount of answers correct or percentage.</li>
<li><b>Controlled Variable:</b>The same number of questions of test, the same difficulty of the tests,and the same website used.
</ul>

<h8><b>Constraints/Criteria</b></h8>
<ul>
<li>At first we didn't know how to code the basics or anything.</li>
<li>We didn't know where we could learn for free or for a cheap price.</li>
<li>Soon we learn that we couldn't get something wrong or that could change the rest of the codes.</li>
<li>When we had the idea of some of the basics, we didn't know where to go to start a html file.</li>
<li>Our project was different from the others, like the variables what did we change in our project.</li>
</ul>
<h9><b>Solutions</b></h9>
<ul>
<li>We found <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/ ">Codecadamy</a> to solve the fact that we needed somewhere to learn.</li>
<li>We went to Mr.Kennen and he gave us the idea of having test tobe our variables, etc.
</ul>
